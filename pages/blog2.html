                    All around us in Florence we can see fantastic architecture that has been preserved for hundreds of years. Art in the form of architecture is something that is not as prevalent in Minneapolis. While there might be some cool buildings here and there, it is far less common to see something that makes you say “Wow”. Here in Florence I am constantly amazed at the beauty and detail in many of the buildings I walk by. The buildings that stand out to me the most are the churches. For this post, I decided to focus on the facades of some of the churches that I have been to. Whether it is a pattern created from different colors of marble or carved inlays adorning the entire surface, the level of craftsmanship that goes into every part of these churches is astounding.
