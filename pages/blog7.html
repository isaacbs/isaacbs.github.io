                    The Sound of Trees 
                    <br><br>
                    I wonder about the trees.
                    <br>
                    Why do we wish to bear
                    <br>
                    Forever the noise of these
                    <br>
                    More than another noise
                    <br>
                    So close to our dwelling place?
                    <br>
                    We suffer them by the day
                    <br>
                    Till we lose all measure of pace,
                    <br>
                    And fixity in our joys,
                    <br>
                    And acquire a listening air.
                    <br>
                    They are that that talks of going      
                    <br>
                    But never gets away;
                    <br>
                    And that talks no less for knowing,
                    <br>
                    As it grows wiser and older,
                    <br>
                    That now it means to stay.

                    <br>
                    My feet tug at the floor
                    <br>
                    And my head sways to my shoulder
                    <br>
                    Sometimes when I watch trees sway,
                    <br>
                    From the window or the door.
                    <br>
                    I shall set forth for somewhere,
                    <br>
                    I shall make the reckless choice
                    <br>
                    Some day when they are in voice
                    <br>
                    And tossing so as to scare
                    <br>
                    The white clouds over them on.
                    <br>
                    I shall have less to say,
                    <br>
                    But I shall be gone.
