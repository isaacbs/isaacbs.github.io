      Hey there, thanks for viewing my website. My name is Isaac Blaine-Sauer and I am currently a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.
      I have a strong interest in applications of machine learning/AI in art and music. One of my goals is training models that can produce enjoyable melodies based on the users 
      favorite kinds of music. As a classically trained violinist, music has been a major part of my life since age 4. I hope to be able to connect the passions I have for violin and artificial intelligence in my future career.
      <br><br>
      In addition to programming, I am an avid home chef and love sharing my food with other people. Trying new recipes and experimenting with old ones in order to achieve a perfect combination of flavors is one of 
      my favorite creative outlets. I also enjoy photography and plan on including a portfolio of my work on this website when I have the time.
      <br><br>
      I love to stay active by either thoroughly destroying my friends at disc golf or getting destroyed on the tennis court. I have found that maintaining a healthy mind-body balance has benefited me immensely throughout my life.
      <br><br>
      Feel free to reach out to me via email at isaac.blaine.sauer@gmail.com or on LinkedIn.
      <br><br>
