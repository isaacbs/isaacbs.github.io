                Hi there. Thanks for stumbling across my website. My name is Isaac Blaine-Sauer and I am a Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota.
                I do not normally create photo blogs, but being in Florence for the semester I decided to try something new and take a photography class.
                My focus for this blog was to document my journey and express my creativity. Italy has been such a surreal experience that it almost feels like a dream. 
                If you have ever had an extremely vivid dream, you know that it is burned into your memory for a few minutes when you wake up, but dissipates almost instantaneously.
                My goal was to create an outlet to share my experience while giving me something to look back on to help me remember.
                <br>
                Each of my posts focuses on one overarching idea. They are not tied to a specific place, but are instead designed to connect the different aspects of Italy 
                which I saw in various places.
                <br>
                I hope you enjoy looking at my photos and reliving my experiences through this website!
                <br>
