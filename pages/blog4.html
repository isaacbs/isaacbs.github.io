                    Over spring break, I decided to travel to Sicily in order to get a change of scenery and experience a completely new part of Italian culture. While the architecture and city layout differs greatly from that of Florence, perhaps the biggest difference I noticed was in the plant life. Disclaimer, I don't really know what the flora looks like in Florence considering there is almost no space for it to grow, but I assume it would be quite similar to that of the rest of Tuscany. In Sicily, the plant life was reminiscent of tropical areas I had been to as well as the desert. Massive cacti lined the roads and palm trees cast much needed swaths of shade. My favorite flower is shown in the third picture. I found the gradient from hot pink to golden yellow to be mesmerizing.
