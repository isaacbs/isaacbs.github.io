                    In this case, everything that you can see that glitters is actually gold. To be more precise, it is a thin sheet of gold leaf layered between two pieces of glass. This was meticulously done for tens of thousands of individual pieces that were used in the mosaics seen in this blog. In the first photo we see the inside of the Palatine Chapel in Sicily. This was one of the most spectacular things I have ever seen, so much so that I had to go back for a second time. It was created for the Normans who were the Kings of Sicily from 999 to 1139 AD. The chapel is inside of their massive palace in the center of Palermo.

                    The second image is inside of the Baptistry of Saint John in Florence. The entire dome of the baptistry is covered in various gold mosaics depicting everything from Jesus to panels telling the story of Joseph. The third image is also in the palace of the Normans, but is inside of King Roger IIâ€™s personal quarters. It is important to notice the differences between the first two and the last mosaic. In the first and second, the imagery is only of religious figures, where in the last we see that it is portraying animals and decorative patterns.
