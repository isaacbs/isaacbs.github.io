                    I have always found abstract shapes engaging and visually pleasing. While it is often difficult to find abstraction in nature,
                    one place that it occurs quite often is in places with large complicated machinery. For this post I focused on train lines. Trains have been 
                    essential this semester. They allowed cheap, convenient, and fast travel all across Italy. It made me realize how much I wish the 
                    United States had a national train system. The pictures I selected do not picture the trains themselves but the lines that they run along.
