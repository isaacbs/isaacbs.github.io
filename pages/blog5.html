                I have visited Boboli gardens a couple of times and each time I do I find it to be a very nice escape from the tall buildings and crampt sidewalks typical of Florence. 
                Something about the absence of grass and the inability to see further than a few blocks in any direction makes me feel constricted. 
                The first time I went to Boboli it was a beautiful sunny afternoon and as soon as I saw an expanse of grass ahead of me, a wave of tranquility passed over me. 
                The benches in the Medici's back yard have been the spot for many fantastic conversations between my friends and I. 
                In this post, I captured some of my friends in various places through out the gardens. 
                My favorite thing about these images is how the speckles of sunlight illuminate different parts of the subjects.
